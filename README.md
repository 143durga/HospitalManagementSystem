Hospital Management System Database üè•
This project contains the database schema for a Hospital Management System, which stores and organizes patient records, doctor information, appointments, and other related data. The database is designed to support the efficient management of hospital operations.

üåü Features
Patient Table: Stores information about patients, including personal details and medical history.
Doctor Table: Contains details about doctors, including specialties and availability.
Appointment Table: Tracks patient appointments with doctors.
Medical Records Table: Stores patient medical records, including diagnoses and treatment plans.
SQL Queries: Provides predefined SQL queries for managing the system's operations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
MySQL: Relational database management system used for storing and querying data.
SQL: Structured Query Language for database management and querying.
MySQL Workbench: Tool used to design the database schema (HospitalManagementSystem.mwb).
üîß Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/143durga/Hospital-Management-System-Database.git
cd Hospital-Management-System-Database
Create the Database: Open the HospitalManagementSystem.mwb file in MySQL Workbench or a compatible database management tool.
Generate the SQL code to create the necessary tables and relationships.

Import Queries: Use queries.sql to execute various SQL commands to interact with the database. Here are some sample queries:

Create Tables:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Doctors (
    doctor_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    specialty VARCHAR(100),
    contact_number VARCHAR(15)
);

CREATE TABLE Patients (
    patient_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    dob DATE,
    contact_number VARCHAR(15),
    address TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    appointment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT,
    doctor_id INT,
    appointment_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES Patients(patient_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES Doctors(doctor_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Medical_Records (
    record_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT,
    diagnosis TEXT,
    treatment TEXT,
    date_of_record DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES Patients(patient_id)
);
Insert Sample Data:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Doctors (first_name, last_name, specialty, contact_number) 
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Cardiologist', '1234567890'),
       ('Jane', 'Smith', 'Neurologist', '0987654321');

INSERT INTO Patients (first_name, last_name, dob, contact_number, address) 
VALUES ('Mark', 'Taylor', '1990-05-15', '1230984567', '123 Main St, City'),
       ('Sarah', 'Johnson', '1985-11-22', '7896541230', '456 Oak St, Town');

INSERT INTO Appointments (patient_id, doctor_id, appointment_date, status) 
VALUES (1, 1, '2024-12-15', 'Scheduled'),
       (2, 2, '2024-12-16', 'Scheduled');
Query Data:

sql
Copy code
-- Retrieve all appointments for a patient
SELECT * FROM Appointments WHERE patient_id = 1;

-- Retrieve medical records for a patient
SELECT * FROM Medical_Records WHERE patient_id = 1;
Run SQL Queries: You can run the queries.sql file to execute all predefined queries in your SQL environment:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u username -p database_name < queries.sql
üåü Future Enhancements
Database Security: Add user authentication and permissions to protect sensitive data.
Integration with Frontend: Develop a web interface to interact with the database and manage the system.
Performance Optimization: Implement indexing and query optimization for large datasets.
